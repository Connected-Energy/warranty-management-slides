### Week 20 Recap

- Last week, the Q1 warranty results showed some BINS entering the black zone.

[Sys0027]{.green}

- Raw data showed that charge for the pack got stuck

- Adjusted calculation of throughput per pack:
    - use `charge_node`/2 for a more accurate computation
    - use 1st life capacity, instead of second

## Re-processing{.smaller}

- [Sys0030]{.green} still showed some BINs in the **black** zone only on '2024-04-03'.

Further look showed:

- At the end of '2024-04-02', the `power_flow_esd` was high, matching the sum across the channels.

- At start of '2024-04-03', the `power_flow_esd` fell to 0, but the power across channel continued to remain high as previously.

Matching it with the event logs:

- At the end of '2024-04-02', `Comms error status changed to 2`

- At mid-day of '2024-04-03', `CommsEror status changed to 0`, aligning with when the charge_channel values returned to normal.

## Next Steps

- Under warranty calculations, try to match events log for comms error ['status changed to 2']{.green} with the `power_flow_esd` to find discrepancies.
- Check if any of the discrepancies lead to throughput entering the `black` zone.
- Retroactively, also check if it shows up in the deviant/threshold dashboard.
