If warranty elapsed 50 days and 1 day was spent in both zones

previously:
$$
1205*(1-0.2)^{50/365}*(1-0.2)^{1/365}*(1-0.2)^{1/365} = 1167.3
$$

now:
$$
1205*(1-0.2)^{50/365}*(1-0.4)^{1/365}*(1-0.6)^{1/365} = 1164.16
$$

## Next week

Implementing the above warranty changes into my classes

- Keeping data_logger functions

- Implement the warranty zone condition in `ClaimDepreciation` class, where we compute the throughput and take account of BIN movements.

- Change the contract details of volvo systems, before moving to changes in `BatteryForecast` class
