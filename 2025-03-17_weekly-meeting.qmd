### Week 15 Recap {.smaller}

Implement the warranty zone condition in `ClaimDepreciation` class:

```python
# example pack location
pack_location = '12a'
# warranty bin labels
warranty_bins = ['green', 'amber', 'red']
#new_list
df_new_zone = []

# depending on which zone the day falls in, check the higher zones for any n_samples count.
for bin in warranty_bins:
    # if the sum of the bin agg is more than 0, loop through each row to adjust the zones
    if df[f'total_{bin}_agg'].sum() > 0:
        df_new_zone.append(
            self._adjust_warranty_zone(
                df = df[df[f"total_{bin}_agg"] > 0],
                bin=bin,
                patterns=["state_of_charge", "temp"],
                battery=pack_location,
            )
        )
```

##

For each battery pack:

- If bin (*Throughput zone*) is ðŸŸ©, check if the **SoC** was in ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´ zone for any particular day
- If bin is ðŸŸ¨, check if the **SoC** was in ðŸ”´ zone for any particular day
- For the above, check if **Temp** was in âš« zone for any particular day

Update the total aggregated n_samples count after each check

Let's look at pack at location [12b]{style="background-color: yellow;"} for an example:

- It did 27 days in [green]{style="color: green;"} zone and 1 day in [amber]{style="color: orange;"} zone.
- During the [amber]{style="color: orange;"} day, the *SoC* was also in [amber & red]{style="background-color: yellow"} zone.
- Thus for `total_amber_agg` we get :
$$
(1 \, day * {n \, samples}) - 1195 = 16085
$$
